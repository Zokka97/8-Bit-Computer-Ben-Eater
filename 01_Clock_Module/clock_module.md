# Intro

Before I started this clock module, I had a prior experience with the components being presented. Therefore, understanding how it works didn't become a problem; most of the struggle is wiring the parts neatly. On the side, I have tried drawing the schematic in AutoCAD but realized that I can use this project as an opportunity to learn KiCad.
