## Personal Goals

- What do I hope to learn from this project?
- What skills do I want to improve or acquire?
- Are there any specific milestones I want to reach?
	I am expecting to learn how computers process data like binaries. Currently, I have an understanding of the basic fundamentals of digital logic. I hope that this project will help fill in the blanks in my understanding of how data is being stored and used by computers. By the end of this course, I should be able to explain the basics of computer processes in layman terms.

### Build an 8-bit computer from scratch

- How detailed do I want my documentation to be?
- What kind of outputs do I hope to produce? (e.g., videos, schematics, written notes)
- How much time per week am I realistically dedicating?

## Project Scope

- What parts of the 8-bit CPU will I focus on first? (e.g., ALU, registers, memory)
- Will I include optional experiments or extensions? (e.g., input/output devices)
