This repository documents my learning process while building Ben Eater’s 8-bit breadboard computer.

## Focus
- Learning how each block of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) works.
- Researching to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work aside from Ben Eater’s instructions.

## Side Focus
- Operate GitHub to document my progress on Ben Eater’s 8-bit project.
- Understanding how to document projects for future references.
- Master Obsidian and Multi-Markdown formatting.

## About Me
I am a Computer Engineer Technology student at New York City College of Technology with a focus on system integration.

Many have helped me throughout the years, especially a Software Engineer friend of mine who started my journey through programming, and a co-worker who sparked my curiosity for electronics.

## Documentation Approach
I will also be using ChatGPT and ProWritingAid to quickly create templates and grammar structures, easing up the documentation process. However, most of the writing will be written by me.
