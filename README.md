This repository documents my learning process while building Ben Eater’s 8-bit breadboard computer.

## Focus:
- Learning how each block of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) works.
- Researching to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work aside from Ben Eater’s instructions.

## Side Focus:
- Operate GitHub to document my progress on Ben Eater’s 8-bit project.
- Understanding how to document projects for futures references.
- Master Obsidian and Multi-Markdown formatting.

I will also be using ChatGPT and ProWritingAid to quickly create templates and grammar structures easing up the documentation process. However, most of the writing will be written by me.
