# 8-Bit Computer (Ben Eater)

This repository documents my learning process while building
Ben Eater’s 8-bit breadboard computer.

Focus:
- Learning how each block of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) works.
- Researching to gain a deeper understanding of how computers works aside from Ben Eater’s instructions.

Side Focus:
- Operate GitHub to document my progress on Ben Eater’s 8-bit project.
- Understanding how to document projects for futures references.
- Master Obsidian and Multi-Markdown formatting.

I will also be using ChatGPT and ProWritingAid to quickly create templates and wording structures easing up the documentation process. However, most of the writing will be written by me.

Note that this repository will only serve as a learning journey for me, it’s not intended to be a guide and might not an accurate for other uses.
