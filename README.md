# 8-Bit Computer (Ben Eater)

This repository documents my learning process while building
Ben Eater’s 8-bit breadboard computer.

Focus:
- Learning how each block of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) works.
- Researching to gain a deeper understanding of how computers works aside from Ben Eater’s instructions.

Side Focus:
- Using GitHub to document my progress on Ben Eater’s 8-bit project.
- Understanding how to document projects for futures references.
- 

Notes are written primarily for myself as a learning log.
