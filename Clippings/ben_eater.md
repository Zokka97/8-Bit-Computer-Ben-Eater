## Overview

I built a programmable 8-bit computer from scratch on breadboards using only simple logic gates. I documented the whole project in a series of YouTube videos and on this web site. Watch this video for an introduction:

## Background

If you’re interested in seeing the computer in action to get a sense of what it can do, check out these videos:

If you want to dive into the details of how the computer works and understand it from first principles, but are a little unsure of how transistors and logic gates work (or just want a refresher), here are a few videos to serve as an introduction:

## Kits

If you’d like to try this project yourself, you can now [buy a complete kit](https://eater.net/8bit/kits) that includes all of the parts used throughout the entire project. These are likely less expensive than sourcing similar high quality parts separately.
